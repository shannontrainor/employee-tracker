# EMPLOYEE TRACKER

## Description
As a business owner  
I want to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company  
So that I can organize and plan my business


## Useage
The Employee Tracker app was created in order to provide the user with a way to view, record, and update their company database. This app is utilized via terminal commands. When opening the terminal, the user will first need to install all necessary npm packages using "npm i". Next when the user requests the node server file, a drop down of options will be presented. The user must choose one option, which include the choice to view employees/roles/departments, add employees/roles/departments, update employee, or exit.  When the user chooses to "view", a table will be displayed in the terminal showing the data the user requested. When the user chooses "add", the user will be prompted to provide furthur information in order to add to the database. Once the information is added, the user may then return back to the "view" selection, and can see the data they added is now a part of the database.
The database & all information from the displayed table was created using MySQL.
